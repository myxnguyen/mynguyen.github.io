# Welcome!

Hello! I'm My, a doctoral student in International Economics at Bielefeld University. My research explores the intersection of international economics and data science, with a particular focus on 
international trade, macroeconomics, trade policy, multinational acquisitions, and global finance. I'm also passionate about econometric methods and cutting-edge techniques such as machine learning 
and natural language processing (NLP), which I actively incorporate into my current and future research.
