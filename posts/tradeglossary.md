Now, with trade agreement, it can buy cheaper shirts from Country B instead.|
|trade diversion | When a trade agreement causes a country to shift its imports from a more efficient producer outside the agreement to a less efficient producer within the agreement. This is generally seen as a negative outcome because it leads to less efficient resource allocation globally.|Before, Country A imported cheap bananas from Country X. After the trade agreement with Country B, Country A shifts to buy more expensive bananas from Country B instead|
|trade circumvention | When businesses try to illegally avoid trade restrictions, like tariffs or quotas, by changing the way goods are shipped or declared. It is essentially finding a loophole or dishonest method to bypass trade rules.| Country A imposes a high anti-dumping duty on steel imports directly from Country X to protect its domestic steel industry. To avoid this duty, a company in Country X ships its steel to Country B, and then re-exports to Country A, often with false documentation claiming Country B as the origin.|
